### Hi there 👋

I'm Stevie-Ray Hartog, a passionate skateboarder and rock climber on a mission to elevate the world of extreme sports. 🌍 Born and bred in the Netherlands. I've carved my path through the concrete jungles and scaled the peaks that beckon to the daring.

### HangTime
As the proud owner of HangTime, an innovative climbing app, I've set out to revolutionise how climbers connect, share experiences, and challenge their limits. 🚀🧗‍♀️ HangTime isn't just an app; it's a community, a digital haven for climbers to map their routes, share tips, and inspire each other to reach new heights.
