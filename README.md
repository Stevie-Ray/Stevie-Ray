### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Stevie, a front-end developer and creator of HangTime, a climbing training app.  I build web apps and tools for climbers, blending my passion for bouldering with web technology. My projects include training apps, Bluetooth device integrations, and tools for interactive climbing boards.
